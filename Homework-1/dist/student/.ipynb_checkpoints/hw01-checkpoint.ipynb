    "NumPy’s arrays are homogeneous: an array can only contain data of a single type. For instance, an array can contain 8-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers, but not a mix of the two. This is in stark contrast to Python’s lists and tuples, which are entirely unrestricted in the variety of contents they can possess; a given list could simultaneously contain strings, integers, and other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction on an array’s contents comes at a great benefit; in “knowing” that an array’s contents are homogeneous in data type, NumPy is able to delegate the task of performing mathematical operations on the array’s contents to optimized, compiled C code. This is a process that is referred to as **vectorization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this can be a tremendous speedup relative to the analogous computation performed in Python, which must painstakingly check the data type of every one of the items as it iterates over the arrays, since Python typically works with lists with unrestricted contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  In the context of a high-level languages like Python, the **term vectorization** describes the use of optimized, pre-compiled code written in a low-level language (e.g. C) to **perform mathematical operations over a sequence of data. This is done in place of an explicit iteration written in the native language code (e.g. a “for-loop” written in Python).**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for instance, the task of summing the integers 0-9,999 stored in an array. Calling NumPy’s `sum` function cues optimized C code to iterate over the integers in the array and tally the sum. `np.sum` is therefore a “vectorized” function. \n",

    "Let’s compare how long it takes to compute this sum using a loop via vectorization using a [Jupyter magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) called `%%time`, which times the execution of that cell. \n",
