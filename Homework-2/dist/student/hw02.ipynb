    "## Due Date: Friday June 6th, 11:59 PM on Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Submission Instructions Are Provided at the end of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Recognize situations where aggregation is useful and identify the correct technique for performing an aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Perform merges on DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use and modify Pandas indices\n",
    " \n",
    " - Identify 5 key data properties to consider when doing Exploratory Data Analysis and implement using data\n",
    " \n",
    " - Understand and implement methods for conditional selection in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    " - Modify columns in a Pandas Dataframe (add, edit, drop)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and implement methods for extracting data using .loc, .iloc, and [].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manipulate and transform Series and DataFrames using common utility functions (i.e. sort_values, info,  value_counts, shape, describe, unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define what is meant by structure and granularity in terms of a set of data, and identify the structure and granularity of sample datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review key Calculus concepts needed in CSCI 3022\n",
    "\n",
    " - Combine Calculus and Discrete Math Prerequisite concepts to determine a Maximum Likelihood Estimate\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity.  However a key step in learning and retention is **creating solutions on your own.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone elseâ€™s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
    "your instructor or teaching assistant rather than another student as this situation can easily\n",
    "lead to a, possibly inadvertent, cheating situation.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the book [MoneyBall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball), Michael Lewis documented the introduction of statistics and data science in selecting players for the Oakland A's. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed. That the statistics traditionally used to gauge players, such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game.  Sabermetrics and statistical analysis had demonstrated, for example, that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better measures of batting. The Oakland A's began seeking players who were \"undervalued in the market\"â€”that is, who were receiving lower salaries relative to their ability to contribute to winning, as measured by these advanced statistics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In this problem, we're going to investigate Oakland A's wins and payroll amounts compared to other successful teams during the time period that Moneyball investigates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Do to this we'll use two datasets from the [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/) which contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2022, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more.\"   \n",
